# PR Flow

A full-height panel on the right of the Herdr window. It lists every open pull request that belongs to a branch an agent is working on, and shows where each one is: CI, review, merge, then the GitHub Actions workflows that run on the merge commit. Clicking a PR swaps the list for its detail in the same panel. It only reads, except when you send a comment on a diff line or the `merge` prop turns on a merge button.

## What you see

The panel is 340px wide, drawn with `theme()` colors on `background`, with a 1px `border` and 10px corners. Every screen has a 42px header with a bottom border. Text is 13px, with 11.5px dim captions.

- **List.** Header: `Pull requests`, a count chip, a settings button, a refresh button (26px, hover `hover`). Cards, 10px padding and 8px corners, selected on `selected`:
  1. Title, truncated, medium weight. Dimmed when merged and all its workflows have settled.
  2. `repo #number · Issue #5` on the left, the update time on the right, in `dim`.
  3. Facts with 12px icons: CI, review, open comment count, merge state.
  4. After a merge: the lead workflow, such as `Deploy · Build (2/5)`, then `+1 more`.
  5. The agent, if there is one: status mark, then `Claude Code · space name`.
- **PR detail.** Header: `List` back button, `GitHub` link. Title at 15px semibold, `owner/repo #n`, `head → base`. An agent row on `raised`, 38px, with `Go`. Then the sections `Progress` (a vertical timeline with 20px marks joined by a 1px `border` line), failed log (the last 8 lines in the terminal font), linked issues, open comments, changed files with `+n −n`, and the description as markdown. `No linked issues` stands in when there are none.
- **Issue.** Header: `PR #n` back button, `GitHub`. Title, state dot and label, number, author, age, label chips, body as markdown, the last 20 comments on `raised`.
- **Settings.** Header: `List` back button, `Settings`. A `Language` section: follow system, 한국어, English, with a check on the chosen one.
- **Viewer pane.** Opened beside a terminal for a diff or a full log. For a diff, a 220px file list (150px below 620px wide) and numbered lines 20px tall, tinted with `ansi2`/`ansi1` at `18` alpha.
- **Empty.** A merge icon, `No pull requests yet`, and one line of help, centered.

Colors by state: passed `ansi2`, failed `ansi1`, changes requested `blocked`, running `working`, merged `ansi5`, not started `dim`.

## How it behaves

- **Agent status.** `working` is a spinning ring in `working`. `blocked` is a dot in `blocked`, `done` a dot in `done`, `idle` a dot in `dim`.
- **Clicks.** A card opens the PR. The agent row runs `agent.focus`. A workflow row, or `CI passed`, expands in place. A changed file or `Show log` opens the viewer, reusing a viewer pane that's already open. `GitHub` opens the browser.
- **Keys**, with the panel focused. List: `j` `k` arrows, `enter`, `g`, `o`, `r`. PR: `enter` or `g`, `o`, `esc` or `backspace`. Issue and settings: `esc` or `backspace`.
- **Owners.** With PRs from more than one owner (the part of `owner/repo` before the slash), a 36 px row under the header: 10 px sides, 4 px gap, bottom border, scrolls sideways. Chips 22 px, 8 px sides, radius 6: `All` and each owner, most PRs first, with the count in `dim`; chosen `selected`, else `raised`. A chip shows only that owner's PRs; the choice is `localStorage` `org`, and an owner with no PRs left shows all. `pr-flow.org:<owner>` chooses one, `pr-flow.org` all.
- **Repos.** With an owner chosen whose PRs are in more than one repo, a 32 px row under it, the same chips: `All repos` and each repo by name, most PRs first. `localStorage` `repo`; choosing another owner clears it. `pr-flow.repo:<owner/name>` chooses a repo and its owner.
- **Commands.** `pr-flow.next`, `prev`, `open`, `back`, `agent`, `github`, `refresh`, `settings`, `lang-auto`, `lang-ko`, `lang-en`.
- **Order.** Newest update first. Merged PRs whose workflows have settled go last. The selection stays on its PR when rows move.
- **What moves.** A timer every 5 s reads agents. PRs are looked for every 30 s for a working agent, every 2 min for an idle one, and straight away when an agent stops working. With `mine`, `gh search prs --author @me --state open` runs every 5 min and adds what it finds. Open PRs refresh every `poll_seconds`, four times slower with no agent. After a merge only Actions is polled, every 15 s, until runs have finished and 3 minutes have passed. Redraws happen only when something visible changed, plus once a minute for relative times.
- **What leaves.** Closed PRs at once. Merged PRs 24 hours after the merge, once their workflows are finished.

## Built from

Files in `mods/pr-flow/`: `main.js` (the only file that imports `gpui-kit`, `gpui-base`, `herdr`), `tracker.js` (the loop, with everything injected), `status.js` and `present.js` (state to words), `flow.js` (Actions runs), `gh.js`, `diff.js`, `text.js`, `i18n.js`, and its SVG icons. `mod.json` is `{ "place": "right", "size": 340 }`.

A layout block: `{ "type": "block", "content": { "mod": "pr-flow", "props": { "poll_seconds": 30, "ci_wait": "2m", "ai_checks": [], "mine": false, "lang": "en" } } }`. All props are optional. The viewer is the same mod with `props: { "screen": "viewer" }`, reading its target from `shared("pr-flow.view")`. The chosen language is `shared("pr-flow.lang")`. The PR list is `localStorage`.

Uses `agents()`, `panes()` (`cwd` and `branch` for each agent), `spaces()` (`machine`), `exec`, `run`, `theme`, `settings`, `shared`, `setShared`, `nextCommand`, `window`. Commands: `agent.focus`, `pane.split`, `pane.focus`, `pane.close`, `tab.new`.

Programs: `gh` (`pr list`, `pr view`, `pr diff`, `issue view`, `run view`, `auth status`, `api` with the GraphQL review threads and linked issues query, `actions/runs?head_sha=`, `actions/runs/<id>/jobs`), `git remote get-url origin`, `sh`, `defaults`, and `open`, `xdg-open` or `explorer.exe`. Nothing it calls writes to GitHub.

## Watch out

- The merge button (`merge`: `"squash"`, `"merge"` or `"rebase"`; anything else, no button) shows under the branch line only when the PR is open, not a draft, `mergeable` is `MERGEABLE` and the state is `ready`. 32 px, radius 8, `raised`; armed, `ansi2` with `background` text for 4 s. It runs `gh pr merge <url> --<method> --match-head-commit <headRefOid shown>`, then refreshes the PR; an error shows under it in `ansi1`. Never `--admin`, never `--delete-branch`.

- Changed files fold from their section header; more than 10 start folded. In the diff, the list's `on_item_click` opens a composer under the diff (a 3-row textarea, `Send`, `Cancel`; `cmd-enter`, `esc`). It runs `gh api -X POST repos/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments` with `-f` for text, then reloads the threads. Open threads render as extra 20 px rows under their line, so the list keeps one row height. On failure the text stays and the error shows.
- Shipped layouts don't take new panels: a mod with `place: "right"` docks only into a personal layout, so `layout.clone` first.
- A virtual list's rows can't register `on_click`, and `herdr-app check` doesn't catch it, since it doesn't run deferred rows. The list is a plain scrolling column.
- An app started from the Finder has no `LANG`. Fall back to `defaults read -g AppleLocale`.
- `exec` stops at 30 s and 8 MiB, so a huge diff or log fails. Offer the GitHub link.
- A saved file reloads the mod, and the old build's waiting `nextCommand()` can swallow the first command after it.
- A commit's combined status can say `pending` with no statuses at all. Read the runs instead.
- GitHub logs start with a byte order mark and mark lines with `##[error]`. Strip both.
- Agent titles, PR titles and logs come from outside: strip escape codes and bidi controls.
- `gh pr list --state all` would find an old merged PR for an agent sitting on `main`. Ask for open PRs only.
- Limits: 100 review threads, 10 linked issues, 50 runs per commit, 50 jobs per run. Issue state isn't refreshed after a merge. Keyboard selection doesn't scroll the list.
- Assumes `gh` is logged in and the remote is called `origin` on GitHub.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check` passes, and the panel docks at the right of a cloned layout.
- With no agent on a PR branch, the empty screen shows. If `gh` isn't logged in, it says so.
- An agent on a branch with an open PR makes a card appear, with that agent named, without any setup.
- Clicking the card shows the timeline, and `List` comes back. The agent row moves focus to that agent's terminal.
- A repo without checks shows `No CI`, and it's never shown as passed.
- PR body `Closes #5` shows `Issue #5` on the card, and clicking it in the PR opens the issue. Without one, `No issue`.
- Merging the PR shows `Merged → main`, then the running workflow and its step, updating as it runs, and finally `2 runs after merge finished`.
- A failing workflow turns red on the card, and `Show log` opens its log in a pane.
- Choosing English in settings changes the text in the panel and the viewer, and it survives a restart.
- No command it runs writes to GitHub.
