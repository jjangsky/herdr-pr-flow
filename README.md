# PR Flow

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

![PR Flow: a PR list and a PR timeline in the Herdr side panel](docs/thumbnail.png)

A side panel for the [Herdr app](https://herdr.dev) that shows every pull request your agents opened and where each one is, from CI through to the workflows that run after a merge.

![PR Flow beside an agent: a PR goes from CI to merged, its deploy workflow runs step by step, then a linked issue and a diff open](docs/demo.gif)

*The real mod in the Herdr app, drawn with made-up projects and data.*

PR Flow only reads, with two exceptions you start yourself: sending a comment on a diff line, and the merge button (`merge`, off by default). It never sends anything to an agent. When something needs doing, jump to the agent and tell it there.

- **No setup.** A PR appears when an agent running in Herdr has one open on its branch, or on a branch in one of its repo's worktrees.
- **Plain facts.** `No CI` and `No review` say so, and never count as passed.
- **After the merge too.** See which workflow is running and which step it's on, using the names in your own workflow files.
- **Linked issues.** Read the issue a PR closes without leaving the panel.

## Status

Early release. See [Releases](https://github.com/jjangsky/herdr-pr-flow/releases) for the current version and what changed. It has been run on macOS with `herdr-app` 0.1.12 against real pull requests and real Claude Code agents. Codex, Linux, Windows and remote machines haven't been tried.

## Requirements

- The Herdr desktop app
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), logged in (`gh auth status`)

## Install

Herdr's built-in layouts don't take new panels, so make your own copy of the layout first. Skip that line if you already use a layout of your own.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jjangsky/herdr-pr-flow
herdr-app do layout.clone '{"name":"main","as":"main-pr"}'
cp -R herdr-pr-flow/mods/pr-flow ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/
herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/pr-flow
```

The panel appears on the right of the window, 340 pixels wide. A copied layout doesn't receive later changes Herdr makes to `main`.

Or ask an agent running in Herdr:

```text
Read ~/.config/herdr-app/AGENTS.md, then add this mod: github.com/jjangsky/herdr-pr-flow
```

To update, run `git pull` in your clone and copy the folder again. When a newer release is out, the panel's header shows `Update v…`: it opens what changed and a prompt to give your agent. To remove it, press `cmd-shift-l` to go back to your earlier layout, then delete `~/.config/herdr-app/mods/pr-flow` and `~/.config/herdr-app/layouts/main-pr.json`. Your terminals and agents aren't affected.

## Using it

**1. Watch the list.** Each card shows the PR, its repo and number, its linked issue, CI and review, and the agent working on it. Click a card to open it. When the PRs span more than one owner, a row of chips under the title shows one owner's PRs (user or organization, with counts); `All` shows them all again. With an owner chosen who has PRs in more than one repo, a second row does the same per repo. The choice is remembered.

**2. Follow a merge.** After a merge, the card shows the workflow that's running and the step it's on. If a run fails, the failure comes first.

**3. Open the PR.** The timeline shows each stage with its time. Every workflow gets its own row. Below it are linked issues, open comments, changed files and the description. Click `Changed files` to fold the list. More than 10 files start folded.

**4. See each step.** Click a workflow to list its jobs and steps. Click `CI passed` to list the checks. A failed run has `Show log`, and `GitHub` opens the run in your browser.

**5. Read the issue.** Click a linked issue to read its labels, body and comments.

<img src="docs/images/en/issue.png" width="340" alt="A linked issue open in the panel">

**6. See the changes.** Click a changed file or a failed log to open it in a pane beside your terminal. Opening another file replaces what the pane shows.

**Leave feedback.** In a diff, click a line, write your comment and press `Send` or `cmd-enter`. It's posted to the PR as a GitHub review comment, from your account, and open comments show under their lines. To have an agent act on it, jump to the agent and ask it to read the PR's comments.

**Merge (optional).** With `merge` set, a PR that is ready to merge gets a `Merge (squash)` button under its branch. The first press arms it for 4 seconds (`Press again to merge`), the second merges. It merges only the commit you were looking at: if something was pushed since, GitHub refuses and the panel shows why.

**7. Tell the agent.** Click the agent row at the top of a PR to jump to its terminal.

### Keys

Click the panel first so it has the keyboard.

| Screen | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List | `j` `k`, arrows | Move |
| List | `enter` | Open the PR |
| List | `g` | Go to the agent |
| List | `o` | Open on GitHub |
| List | `r` | Refresh |
| PR | `enter`, `g` | Go to the agent |
| PR | `o` | Open on GitHub |
| PR, issue, settings | `esc`, `backspace` | Back |
| Issue | `o` | Open on GitHub |

## Reading the states

| Shown | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CI` with a check | Every check passed |
| `CI running 2/4` | 2 of 4 checks have finished |
| `CI failed` | At least one check failed |
| `No CI` | No check reported, even after waiting `ci_wait` for a new commit |
| `Approved`, `Changes requested`, `Waiting for review` | GitHub's review decision |
| `AI reviewing`, `Reviewed` | An AI review job is running, or a review exists without a decision |
| `No review` | Nobody has reviewed it |
| Comment icon and a number | Review threads still open |
| `Merge conflict`, `Ready to merge` | What GitHub reports |
| `Merged → main` | Merged, and into which branch |
| `Deploy · Build (2/5)` | That workflow's current step |
| `Deploy · waiting for approval` | The run is waiting for someone to approve it |
| `2 runs after merge finished` | All of them succeeded |
| `Issue #5`, `2 issues`, `No issue` | Issues linked to the PR |

Jobs such as `claude-review` are recognized as AI review by name, so their result isn't reported as a CI failure. Add others with `ai_checks`.

A finished workflow means its job succeeded. It doesn't prove your service is healthy.

### Linking an issue

An issue shows up when GitHub links it to the PR: a keyword such as `Closes #5` in the PR body, or a link set in the PR's sidebar. A plain `#5` isn't a link. Asking your agent to write `Closes #<number>` is enough.

## How PRs are found and refreshed

PR Flow asks GitHub on a timer, so it can lag behind by the times below.

| What | How often |
| --- | --- |
| Agent status | 5 seconds |
| New PR, working agent | 30 seconds, and right after it finishes |
| New PR, idle agent | 2 minutes |
| Your open PRs, with `mine` | 5 minutes |
| Open PR with an agent | `poll_seconds` (30 seconds) |
| Open PR without an agent | 4 × `poll_seconds` (2 minutes) |
| Workflows after a merge | 15 seconds while running |

Once found, a PR stays listed after its agent exits or changes branch. A closed PR leaves the list. A merged one leaves 24 hours after the merge, once its workflows have finished.

## Settings

The settings button at the top of the panel chooses the language: follow the system, 한국어 or English. It also shows your version, and `Check for new versions` turns the update notice off or on. `Later` hides the notice until the next release.

Everything else goes in the block's `props` in your layout file (`~/.config/herdr-app/layouts/main-pr.json`):

```json
{ "type": "block", "content": { "mod": "pr-flow", "props": { "poll_seconds": 60, "ci_wait": "5m", "ai_checks": ["nightly review"] } } }
```

| Prop | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `poll_seconds` | `30` | How often an open PR refreshes. The minimum is 10 |
| `ci_wait` | `"2m"` | How long a new commit waits for checks before showing `No CI` |
| `ai_checks` | `[]` | CI jobs that are really AI review |
| `mine` | `false` | Also list every open PR you authored, with or without an agent on it |
| `merge` | none | `"squash"`, `"merge"` or `"rebase"`: show a merge button on PRs ready to merge, using that method. Unset, nothing is ever written |
| `lang` | system | `"en"` or `"ko"`, used until you choose in settings |

## What it runs

This is what the mod does on your machine, all with your own login. It stores no credentials.

- `gh pr list`, `gh search prs --author @me` (with `mine`), `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh issue view`, `gh run view` and read-only `gh api` calls
- At most once a day, `gh api repos/jjangsky/herdr-pr-flow/releases/latest` for the update notice. It never installs anything
- When you send a comment: `gh api -X POST repos/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments`
- With `merge`, when you press the button twice: `gh pr merge <url> --<method> --match-head-commit <sha>`. No `--admin`, no branch deletion
- `git remote get-url origin` and `git worktree list --porcelain` in each agent's folder
- `gh pr list` once per repo, to match open PRs with its worktrees' branches
- `sh` to read your language, and `defaults` on macOS when the app has no `LANG`
- `open`, `xdg-open` or `explorer.exe` to open a link

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| No panel after installing | The built-in `main` layout doesn't take new panels. Run the `layout.clone` line, then copy the folder again under a fresh start: remove `mods/pr-flow`, then copy it |
| `GitHub CLI is not ready` | Run `gh auth login`, then refresh |
| A PR is missing | Check that an agent is running in that repo, on the PR's branch or with it in a worktree, the PR is open, and the folder's `origin` is on GitHub |
| A linked issue is missing | Use `Closes #5` in the PR body. A plain `#5` isn't a link |
| No workflows after a merge | The repo has no GitHub Actions run on the merge commit. Other deploy systems aren't shown |
| `Could not load the log` | Very large logs can pass the app's 30 second and 8 MiB limit. Open it on GitHub |

## Limits

- PRs are found through agents running in Herdr: on the agent's branch, or on a branch checked out in a worktree of the agent's repo. A worktree PR is attached to the agent only when it's the one agent in that repo. An agent started in a folder above the repo finds nothing. PRs you opened elsewhere aren't listed unless `mine` is on. PRs that only ask for your review aren't listed.
- The refresh button updates listed PRs. It doesn't look for new ones, which arrive on the timer above.
- Step-by-step tracking is for GitHub Actions after a merge. Before a merge you see each check's name and result. Deploys outside Actions, such as Vercel, aren't shown.
- Comments go on one line of the diff, and each is sent right away, not as a batch. A thread shows up to 20 comments.
- A flow across two PRs, such as `development` then `live`, shows as two separate PRs.
- After a merge, a listed issue's state isn't refreshed. Opening the issue always loads it fresh.
- Herdr must be running for the panel to refresh. The repo must be on GitHub, and the remote must be called `origin`.
- It polls while the panel is hidden too, so many PRs use more of your GitHub API limit. Raise `poll_seconds` if needed.

## Development

```sh
npm test                                       # needs Node.js 20 or later
herdr-app check "$PWD/mods/pr-flow"
python3 scripts/demo/capture.py /tmp/prdemo en out   # redraws the README's screens with made-up data
```

The mod is plain JavaScript with no dependencies. Only `main.js` touches the app, so the rest runs under Node in tests. `RECIPE.md` is the brief for rebuilding it. `capture.py` needs Pillow, and opens a separate Herdr window for about a minute.

### Releasing

From an up-to-date `main`, bump the version and push the tag. `patch` is for fixes, `minor` for new features:

```sh
npm version minor -m "Release v%s"
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

`npm version` also writes the version into `mods/pr-flow/version.js`, which the update notice compares with the latest release. The tag runs the tests and publishes a GitHub release with notes from the merged PRs. A tag that doesn't match `package.json` fails.
